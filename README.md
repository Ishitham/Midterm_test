## Overview
This Tableau project analyzes startup investments from Shark Tank India, covering Seasons 1, 2, and 3. The dataset contains detailed information about the startups, sharks, industries, and the deal types made during the show, we aim to answer the following questions:
- Which sharks invest the most?
- What industries attract the highest investments?
- How do startup success metrics (like revenue and margins) vary across industries?

### Problem to Solve:
The primary problem is identifying which startups receive the highest investments, what factors contribute to their success, and understanding the preferences of each shark in terms of deal types (equity, debt, or royalty). Additionally, it seeks to answer how different industries perform in terms of revenue and investment.

## Analysis
The Shark Tank India dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of investment patterns, industry performance, and startup characteristics. Sharks like Namita, Anupam, and Vineeta are the leading investors, with Namita contributing the highest at â‚¹2,219 lakhs. These sharks prefer equity-based deals, though some also engage in debt-based investments, reflecting their varied risk appetites. Startups such as NasherMiles and WeHear have attracted the largest investments, suggesting strong business models and growth potential. In terms of industry performance, the Electronics sector stands out, with the highest average yearly revenue, despite industries like Food and Beauty/Fashion having a larger number of startups. This indicates that while some industries are popular, others generate higher revenue, showcasing the growth potential of technology-based startups. Interestingly, only 9% of the startups have patented products, demonstrating that most of the investment goes towards market-driven products rather than proprietary innovations. The data also reveals a significant gender gap, with male presenters far outnumbering female presenters, highlighting a disparity in representation within the startup ecosystem. Overall, the analysis provides key insights into the preferences of sharks, the success of startups across industries, and the trends driving investment on the show.
